## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

This project was a lot of fun and, like in every other challenge, it pushes you
to think about where and how to place your content in the component so that it
looks good in both mobile and desktop views. I think there are things that can
be improved and it would be even possible to code this challenge without using
JavaScript, but that could be a next step in the future.
