## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

This challenge was a good Flexbox practice. After completing several of these
projects, I'm improving my decision making in terms of layouts and what the best
approach so the final product looks closer to the original design, even withouth
using the Figma files.
