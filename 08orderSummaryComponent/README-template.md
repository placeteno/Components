## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

This project was a little challenging to build at first, not because of the
content itself, but because you need to carefully plan the layout you need to
place all the elements in the right position. I ended up changing it twice until
I landed on the one I think works better in both desktop and mobile views (I
took some liberties, although it's pretty close to the original). This is what I
like about these challenges, they may seem simple, but that doesn't mean you
don't need to plan ahead before coding.

### Continued development

For future projects I need to focus more on planning the layout before I write
any piece of code and referencing the mobile view together with the desktop view
to create the best layout that works on both modes. Overall, a great project to
practice.
