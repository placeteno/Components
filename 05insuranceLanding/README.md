## My process

This was another good project to practice layouts. I learned a couple of new
things, like the <picture> tag and <srcset> to switch images based on screen
sizes. I started the project with mobile-first and I have to say it felt more
natural going from mobile to desktop, although that depends on the project. In
any case, a good project to practice CSS.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
